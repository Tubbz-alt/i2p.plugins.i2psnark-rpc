Setting up a build environment for I2PSnark-RPC
===============================================

These build instructions seem to work with both git and mtn.

1. You can build I2PSnark-RPC using either the packages that come with
an I2P installation or with packages from the I2P code. 

If you have an existing I2P installation and want to use it, you should set
the I2P environment variable to point to your I2P Installation. If you
installed I2P via the .jar, this will be $HOME/i2p. On Apple, the I2P
libraries are found at `/Applications/i2p`. If you have installed I2P using
a Debian package(i.e. `sudo apt-get install i2p i2p-router`) then you have
libraries available at /usr/lib/i2p.

If you have the I2P source code in ../i2p relative to the parent directory,
and have run `ant pkg`, then the libraries will automatically be detected.

        ./i2p/pkg-tmp
        ./i2p.plugins.i2psnark-rpc

2. Copy plugin.config from the scripts directory into the plugin directory.

        cp scripts/plugin.config plugin/plugin.config

3. If you don't have plugin signing keys yet, you will need to generate them.

To do this with I2P installed in the $HOME directory, you can run the following
script:
        
        java -cp "~/i2p/lib/i2p.jar:/usr/share/java/gnu-getopt.jar" \
          net.i2p.crypto.SU3File keygen -t RSA_SHA512_4096 \
          "~/.i2p-plugin-keys/user-su3-public-signing.crt" \
          "~/.i2p-plugin-keys/user-su3-keystore.ks" \
          "user@mail.i2p"

There is a helper script to make this process easier at
[i2pgit.org](https://i2pgit.org/idk/generate-plugin-signing-keys)
[git.idk.i2p](https://i2pgit.org/idk/generate-plugin-signing-keys). If you
have never generated plugin signing keys before, you can run the command:

        ./i2pk -p $HOME/.i2p-plugin-keys -n 'user' -s 'user@mail.i2p' generate_keys

4. Edit the plugin/plugin.config file. You will need to change the signer field to
match your keys, and add a version line to the file.

         name=i2psnark-rpc
        -signer=zzz-plugin@mail.i2p
        +signer=user@mail.i2p
         consoleLinkName=I2PSnark-Remote
         consoleLinkURL=/transmission/web/
         description=RPC and Web UI for i2psnark
         min-java-version=1.7
         min-jetty-version=9
         min-i2p-version=0.9.47
        +version=0.1.2-test

5. You should be ready to build the plugin. Run the script scripts/makeplugin.sh
from the project root.

        ./scripts/makeplugin.sh

You will be prompted to generate your keystore password. Once entered, the 
i2psnark-rpc plugin packages will be generated.
